## Project Description

**ZOI** is a full-stack web application designed for a beauty store.

The application has two types of users: **Admin** and **Customer**.

The **Admin** can manage the store's products by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting products. The Admin can also manage shipments by adding, viewing, editing, deleting, and tracking shipments.

The home page includes a small dashboard that provides visual information about the store's products and shipments, allowing the Admin to quickly view the current status of the store.

**Customers** can browse available beauty products, view product details, add products to their cart, edit or remove items from their cart, and complete the checkout process. Customers can also view and track their shipments.

The application uses **session-based authentication and role-based authorization** to ensure that Admin users can manage store data while Customers can access the shopping features available to them.

## Background

I built **ZOI** as a full-stack web application to practice developing a complete beauty store system using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS**.

The idea was to create a simple and user-friendly beauty shopping experience while also providing an Admin with the tools needed to manage products and shipments.

This project allowed me to apply concepts such as **CRUD operations, authentication, authorization, database relationships, sessions, and server-side rendering** in one complete application.
